\emph{Summary:}
There are various uses for information theory.
In this session we will explore some of them.

\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
After this session you should be able
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{understand} how Shannon entropy can be applied in various 
    areas.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Reading:}
You should read on the use of entropy to estimate identifiability,
\citetitle{Eckersley2010hui}~\cite{Eckersley2010hui};
anonymity, \citetitle{MeasuringAnonymity}~\cite{MeasuringAnonymity} and
\citetitle{InfoTheoreticMetricForAnonymity}~\cite{InfoTheoreticMetricForAnonymity} 
(read one of these);
password variety, \citetitle{Komanduri2011opa}~\cite{Komanduri2011opa}.
