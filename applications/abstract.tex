\emph{Summary:}
There are various uses for information theory.
In this session we will explore some of them.

\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
After this session you should be able
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{understand} how Shannon entropy can be applied in various 
    areas.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Reading:}
You should read on the use of entropy to estimate anonymity:
\citetitle{Eckersley2010hui}~\cite{Eckersley2010hui}.
This is then utilised in the text \citetitle{Bosk2013gl}~\cite{Bosk2013gl} (in 
Swedish), and \citetitle{Komanduri2011opa}~\cite{Komanduri2011opa} which treats 
passwords.
