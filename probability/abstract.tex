% XXX Summary
\emph{Summary:}
Probability theory is a fundamental area of mathematics.
It is widely used: in computer science (randomized algorithms), information 
theory (stochastic processes) but also machine learning (bayesian inference).
In this learning session we will cover some of the basics.

% XXX Motivation and intended learning outcomes
\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
After the session you should be able
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{apply} probability theory to analyze problems in various 
    fields.
\end{itemize}
